This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

## Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variables to be set. Create a .env file in the root directory with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://pr-42389.masterclass.dev/jsonapi/v1/
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL - The email address to be used in API requests
```

Note: These variables use the NEXT*PUBLIC* prefix, which makes them available in the browser.

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
